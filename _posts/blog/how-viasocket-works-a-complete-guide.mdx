Let me introduce you to **viaSocket** — a powerful platform that connects your favorite apps and takes care of the busy work by automating tasks, so you can focus on what really matters.

Currently, viaSocket offers an extensive range of over 5,000 app integrations, with new integrations being added regularly. This ever-expanding library ensures that you can connect and automate any tool you use, making your workflow smoother and more efficient.

In this blog post, we’re going to discuss what viaSocket is, how it works, and how you can start using it to make your day-to-day a whole lot easier.

## What is viaSocket?

viaSocket is a powerful AI-driven, web-based workflow automation tool that allows users to connect and automate tasks between different web applications.

With viaSocket, you can automate repetitive tasks and integrate different apps with ease—no coding or technical skills required. It acts as a bridge between apps, enabling them to work together by setting up "Workflow" triggered by specific events.

For example, imagine you're running a small online business and want to ensure that every potential customer who reaches out to you through your website receives immediate attention.

With viaSocket, you can set up an automated workflow that triggers when a customer fills out the contact form on your website and performs actions like adding their details to your CRM for follow-up, sending them a thank-you email, and sending a Slack notification.

This way, your CRM stays up to date without any manual effort, and your customers feel valued with instant, personalized responses.

## How does viaSocket Work?

Now that you know what viaSocket is, let’s talk about how you can make the most of it. Getting started with viaSocket involves multiple key steps. We’ll guide you through each one, ensuring you understand the process completely.

You are done here. In the next step, we'll set up the "Trigger".

## Step 3: Set Up Your Trigger

Now, you'll set up the "Trigger" app. This is the app that will initiate the automation.

**1.** Enter the name of the app you want to use as the trigger in the "Select an App" search box. Then select it from the list.

**2.** Choose the specific trigger event from the list of available options.

**3.** Click on the Edit icon where it says "Enter Flow Name". Enter your preferred name for the workflow. Below that, you can add a brief description of your workflow.

**4.** Connect your account to the trigger app by clicking “Authenticate Now”.

**5.** Test the trigger by clicking "Test." If you need to make any changes, simply click "Update" to adjust the authentication.

**6.** Once the test is successful, viaSocket will retrieve data from the connected app to confirm that the trigger is working correctly.

## Step 4: Set Up Action Steps

Now, you'll set up the "Action" app. This is the app that will perform an action based on the trigger.

**1.** Type the app name you want to use as the action in the "Search and Add New Step" section, and select it from the list. For example, Trello.

**2.** Choose the specific action event from the list of available options.

**3.** Connect your account to the action app by clicking “Authenticate Now”.

**4.** Configure the action by filling in the required fields. To use data from the trigger app, simply click on the field and select the appropriate data from the available options.

**5.** Test the action by clicking "Test and Save". viaSocket will perform the action using the data from the trigger test. Check the connected app to verify that the action was successfully executed.

**6.** Once the test is successful, publish your workflow to make it live. Once live, it will run automatically whenever the trigger event occurs.

You can always return to the viaSocket workspace to make changes, discard them, or turn off the workflow as needed.
