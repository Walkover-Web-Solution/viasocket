You might wonder what a **“Webhook”** is. While the term might sound unfamiliar, you're probably already connected to it in ways you don’t even realize.<br /><br />

Whenever you notice instant responses in your apps and websites, it’s usually thanks to a webhook. **Think of it like a phone call:** where two people exchange real-time information quickly and easily.<br /><br />

A webhook lets apps talk to each other and automatically send notifications when something new happens. If you want to automatically transfer data from one app to another, knowing how to use webhooks is key.<br /><br />

To know more about webhooks, spare a few minutes from your busy schedule and explore the magic of webhooks and get you favorite apps to talk to each other using [viaSocket’s webhooks.](https://viasocket.com/integrations/webhook?currentcategory=All)<br/><br />

**What is a Webhook?**<br/><br />

![Login Screen](/uploads/webhooks-definition-working-usage-and-examples-a-complete-guide1.gif)<br />

Webhook is like a real-time notification system between apps. Whenever something happens in one app—like a new comment or a purchase—a webhook sends a signal to another app, instantly letting it know about the event.<br /><br />

However webhooks aren’t the only way to get apps talking to each other. You can also use APIs, known as [polling triggers](https://viasocket.com/faq/polling-triggers) to share information between applications. There’s a key difference between the two, and it’s important to understand how they work.<br /><br />

**Polling** is like checking with the newspaper vendor every day to see if the latest edition is available. **Webhooks**, on the other hand, are like having a newspaper delivered to your doorstep every morning.<br /><br />

In the case of **polling**, the API routinely checks at specific intervals to see if there have been any updates or changes. It’s like setting a timer to repeatedly ask, "Has anything new happened?"<br /><br />

**Webhooks** are like getting immediate updates delivered to you as soon as they happen without setting up a timer, making them more efficient for managing data and payloads.<br /><br />

Webhooks are usually faster than polling and require less effort from you. Use a webhook when you need real-time updates without constant checking. Polling is better when webhooks aren't available or if you only need occasional updates.<br /><br />

**How Does Webhook Work?**<br /><br />

**Webhooks** work by enabling one system to automatically notify another system when a specific event occurs, without the need for constant polling. When a webhook is triggered, the system sends a regular HTTP request—often a POST request—to the URL you provided, containing event-specific data in a serialized format, typically JSON or XML.<br /><br />

Upon receiving the webhook request, your application should handle it like any other HTTP request. Although webhooks are a one-way communication system, it’s best practice to return a `200` or `302` status code to confirm receipt of the data. \
\
This acknowledgment lets the source application know that your system processed the webhook successfully. Moreover, it is advisable to make your **webhook handling process idempotent**—ensuring that even if the same webhook request is sent multiple times (a common scenario with some providers), your system won’t process it redundantly or cause errors, preventing data duplication or system compromise.<br /><br />

To make it clearer, you can use a webhook for new contacts. When a new contact is added, the data is automatically sent to the other application's webhook URL. It’s a simple, automatic connection between the two systems.<br /><br />

**How to Use a Webhook?**<br /><br />

Now that you understand what a webhook is and how it works, let's dive into the exciting part—the **experimental** phase! This is where we’ll actually see how to use a webhook to establish seamless communication between two applications.<br /><br />

There are **two ways to set up a webhook:** one involves writing extensive code, and the other takes advantage of built-in webhook functionalities offered by various applications. \
\
Remember, you don’t need to know how to build webhooks from scratch to use them. Instead, focus on learning how to use webhooks by configuring them in your [favorite apps](https://viasocket.com/integrations/).<br /><br />

Let’s take [**Shopify**](https://www.shopify.com/in/free-trial/3-steps?term=shopify&adid=566014743975&campaignid=15433369407&branded_enterprise=1&BOID=brand&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwreW2BhBhEiwAavLwfEosAtTcYEOiDChrIvJMb-uevOyIk2t6YiwjbjR4uTCf61WWn5XKdRoCfKcQAvD_BwE&cmadid=516585705;cmadvertiserid=10730501;cmcampaignid=26990768;cmplacementid=324494758;cmcreativeid=163722649;cmsiteid=5500011) and [**Slack**](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/) as our example this time. Shopify (an e-commerce platform) and Slack (a communication tool) both support webhooks, and we’ll show how they can work together.<br /><br />

Let’s say you want to get notified in a Slack channel every time a new product is added to your Shopify store. To make this happen, **we'll set up a webhook between Slack and Shopify**. Here's how you can do it:<br /><br />

### **Step 1: Get the Slack Webhook URL**<br /><br />

First, we need the Slack webhook URL that will send the notifications to your channel. Head over to Slack, then:<br /><br />

![Login Screen](/uploads/webhooks-definition-working-usage-and-examples-a-complete-guide2.png)<br /><br />

<ol>
    <li>1. Click on the **Apps** section.</li>
    <li>2. Search for "webhook" and select **Incoming Webhooks** from the options.</li>
    <li>3. Now, choose the channel where you want to receive notifications.</li>
    <li>4. Click on **Add Incoming Webhook Integration**—this will generate a unique URL for you.</li>
    <li>5. Copy this URL; we'll need it later.</li> <br /> <br />
</ol>

### **Step 2: Test the Webhook URL**<br /><br />

Before we move to Shopify, it's always a good idea to test the webhook URL to make sure everything works. You can use a tool like [**Postman**](https://www.postman.com/) or [**RequestBin**](https://pipedream.com/requestbin)**.**<br /><br />

### **Step 3: Set Up the Webhook in Shopify**<br /><br />

Now that we have the Slack webhook URL ready, it’s time to set up the connection in Shopify:<br /><br />
![Login Screen](/uploads/webhooks-definition-working-usage-and-examples-a-complete-guide4.png)<br /><br />

<ol>
    <li>1. In your Shopify admin panel, go to **Settings**.</li>
    <li>2. Scroll down and click on **Create Webhook**.</li>
    <li>
        3. In the event dropdown, select **Product Creation**—this will trigger the webhook every time a new product is
        added to your store.
    </li>
    <li>4. Paste the Slack webhook URL into the URL field.</li>
    <li>5. Save the webhook settings.</li>
</ol> <br />

And that’s it! Now, every time you add a new product in your Shopify store, you’ll get an instant notification in your Slack channel. It’s an easy and efficient way to stay updated! <br /><br />

# **Real Life Example of a Webhook**<br /><br />

Let’s say Jack visits your photography website and signs up for your newsletter. Now, you want his email to be automatically added to your email marketing platform, like [Mailchimp](https://viasocket.com/integrations/mailchimp?currentcategory=All). This is where the webhook comes into play.<br /><br />

First, Mailchimp needs to know where to receive Jack’s email. Just like giving your phone number to a friend so they can contact you, you need to provide **Mailchimp’s webhook URL** to your website. This URL acts as the destination where your website will "call" whenever someone signs up for the newsletter.<br /><br />

You’d start by going into Mailchimp, creating a list, and copying the **webhook URL**. It generates—something like `yourapp.com/webhooks/subscribe/abc123`. Then, head over to your website’s settings and paste this URL into the webhook field. This URL now acts like Mailchimp’s "phone number," telling your website where to send the subscriber data whenever someone signs up.<br /><br />

When Jack fills out the subscription form, your website sends his email and details over to Mailchimp using that webhook URL. The data is usually serialized in a format like JSON, looking something like this:<br/><br />

\{

<span style={{ color: 'green' }}>
    <br />
    "email": "jack@example.com"
</span>

<span style={{ color: 'green' }}>"email": name": "Jack"</span>
<br />
<span style={{ color: 'green' }}>"subscription_date": "2024-09-09"</span>  <br />   }   

With this data, Mailchimp automatically adds Jack to your mailing list, ensuring he’s all set to receive your newsletters—without you needing to do anything manually.<br /><br />

# **Frequently Asked Questions**<br /><br />

### **1.What is a Webhook?**

A webhook is an HTTP-based callback function that enables real-time, event-driven communication between two APIs. When an event occurs in one app, the webhook sends data instantly to another app's URL, allowing efficient and automated interactions between systems.<br /><br />

### **2.What is Webhook used for?**

Webhooks are used to automate real-time communication between applications. They send data instantly when a specific event occurs, eliminating the need for constant manual checking. Common uses include triggering notifications, syncing data between apps, processing payments, and automating tasks like updating databases or sending emails.<br /><br />

### **3.What is the difference between a hook and a webhook?**

Hooks operate internally within the same system or application, allowing different parts of the code to interact and modify each other. Webhooks, on the other hand, connect different systems or applications. They enable one app to send data to another app automatically when a specific event occurs, using an HTTP-based callback. <br /><br />

**4. What is the difference between API & Webhook?**

An API is request-based, where one system actively asks for data from another and gets a response. It requires constant polling to check for updates. A webhook is event-driven, automatically sending data to another system when a specific event happens, making it more efficient for real-time updates.
